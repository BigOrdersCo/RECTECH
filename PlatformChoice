Case for Mobile App Approach
User Experience

Performance:
Speed and Responsiveness: Mobile apps are typically faster and more responsive than websites, providing a smoother user experience crucial for on-demand services like BigOrders.
Design and Intuitiveness:
Platform-Specific Design: Mobile apps can be designed specifically for iOS and Android, offering a more intuitive and cohesive experience tailored to the user's device.
Functionality

Device Integration:
GPS and Location Services: Essential for real-time tracking of deliveries, optimizing routes for drivers, and providing accurate delivery estimates.
Push Notifications: Critical for keeping users informed about order status, promotions, and other important updates.
Camera Integration: Useful for features like scanning QR codes or taking photos of delivered items as proof of delivery.
Offline Access:
Order History and Cached Data: Users can access past orders and essential information even when offline, improving overall reliability.
Engagement

Push Notifications:
User Retention and Engagement: Push notifications are effective in keeping users engaged, notifying them about order statuses, special offers, and promotions, driving repeat usage.
Marketing: Enables targeted marketing strategies to engage users with personalized offers and updates.
Home Screen Presence:
Ease of Access: Having the app icon on the home screen keeps the service top-of-mind and easily accessible, increasing the likelihood of frequent use.
Additional Considerations

User Expectations:
Market Norms: Users have come to expect on-demand delivery services to be available as mobile apps. Competing services like Uber Eats, Grubhub, and Postmates all offer dedicated mobile apps, setting a standard in the industry.
Operational Efficiency:
Driver Interface: A mobile app can provide a dedicated interface for delivery drivers, enhancing their experience with features like optimized routing, order management, and communication tools.
Customer Support: In-app customer support features, such as chat and direct calls, can improve service efficiency and user satisfaction.
Addressing Potential Cons
Development and Maintenance Costs:
While developing and maintaining separate apps for iOS and Android can be expensive, the investment is justified by the enhanced user experience and engagement. Cross-platform development frameworks like React Native or Flutter can also mitigate some costs.
Accessibility:
While a mobile app requires users to download it, effective marketing strategies and incentives (e.g., discounts on the first order) can encourage downloads. Additionally, a complementary mobile-friendly website can serve users who prefer not to download the app or who are discovering the service for the first time.
Conclusion
Given the nature of an on-demand delivery service like DoorDash, the mobile app approach is superior due to its ability to deliver a high-quality, responsive user experience, leverage device features essential for real-time operations, and maintain strong user engagement through push notifications and home screen presence. This approach aligns with industry standards and user expectations, providing a competitive edge in the market.
